## Overview


## Discussion Questions
1. What levels of autonomous vehicles do you think should be allowed on reads?
2. Who should we blame when an autonomous vehicle, in the intermediate levels (2,3,4), has an accident? Is it the driver's fault, or the manufacturer's?
3. Do you think development on autonomous vehicle technology should be paused to allow for regulation to catch up?
