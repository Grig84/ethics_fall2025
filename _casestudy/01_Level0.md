### What Features Are Present
Level 0 contains barely any features - it just encompasses passive technologies, like blind spot monitoring, or the beep that lets you know you are out of your lane. This also would include messages about following distance or reccomendations to brake, but only when they are not acted upon by the car. The vehicle has no control of what it actually is doing, and can only provide alerts. 

### Examples
At this level, you will see most budget vehicles from the early 2000's and before, or any vehicle without cruise control. Examples of this are prevalent everywhere, and while it was available as on option on most cars since the late 60s, cruise control was still not standard on some cars until the early 2010s, including the Mini Cooper, Honda Civic, and Ford Ranger. Even on the 2023 Chevrolet Cruze, cruise control was still an added option. AThese cars have become quite rare, but they are the most basic and fundamental thing that comes to mind when you think car.

### Security
These vehicles have no vulnerabilities with respect to the network, since very few of them are connected at all. Taking control of the vehicle requires fully physical methods, and there is no risk of anyone taking control of the vehicle while you are driving unless they are in the car with you.

### Safety
Because of the lack of driver aids, these vehicles cannot make up for bad driving, and offer an unrestricted driving experience. The driver is in full control, for good and bad, and every mistake they make is operated on by the car.
