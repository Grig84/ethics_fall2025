In this episode of *Dark Mode*, we create our own plots for dark mirror episodes, and explore how tech currently in development can affect our society.

## Episode 1: Me, Robot?
In a world where cybernetic augmentations are the norm, Lisa wants her own. Years ago, she went to get her keycard to her apartment implanted, but faced an issue - her body rejected the implant. Now that everyone around her has augmented memories, implanted keycards and wallets, and 20/10 eyesight, how can Lisa keep up? The standard person is augmented, and thus Lisa got replaced in her job as an engineer by a 'borg', and they're coming for her house next. 

Lisa decides to take matters into her own hands, and finally get an augmentation of her own. After getting turned down at the *Augment Emporium* for being allergic, she gets stopped by someone by her car, telling her he can get her the augmentation she wants. She follows him into the alley, and gets her augmentation. She starts doing better, and gets her job back. She finally feels like she can keep up with everyone else, until the day she breaks into a cold. At first, she thought nothing of it, until it just kept getting worse. She went to the hospital, but by that point it was too late. Her augmentations had killed her.
